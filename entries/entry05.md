### Context/EDP
Blog 5 is about me finishing the MVP, explaining the diffifulty I have to go through to make my chatbox functional reformat my font-end of my project. For example I change my layout by using [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/55bzqv). Right now I'm still in the EDP of **create and test** to make sure my MVP is functional with the minimum requirement I need for this project. It doesn't matter if it look good, it can look the worst it can be, long as it work probably I can use it to show off what I have made. 

### MVP 
In the last blog I had to struggle with the firebase chat box conflict, where I wasn't able to target my value from firebase. I solve it by using this code `txt.innerHTML= messages.USERNAME  + ": " +  messages.MESSAGE;` through using many [sources](https://github.com/jimingz9380/sep11-freedom-project/tree/main/sep11-project(https://www.cometchat.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-chat-app-with-firebase)). I even had to look at the previous source and compare what was the difference and how I can create my own code that will make the chat box work [Firebase reference](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/database). Another part I changed about MVP was the entire layout, I changed it because I didn't like how it looked. Even though I had resolved my major problem with getting closer to MVP, I wasn't able to make it where your history of text is saved into a realtime database when refreshing the web. On the other hand, my project is related to a chatbox, so I made it more fitting where people would go onto the website and chat about. I thought the best would be a draw box using the picture I had down below.

### Next Step
My next goal for the project is to finish the minor problem for MVP for both Firebase base and my p5.js and start working on beyond mvp. This is where I start making my MVP to look better and polish it.

### Takeaway
This blog entry has helped me develop the skill of embracing <ins>failure and how to learn</ins>, through this journey to make the MVP I had a lot of failures that I needed to solve through google. Even now I still have issues in my website that are still needed to be worked on. Everytime I fail, I alway learn something because when there is a problem there is a solution to everything and with knowing there is a solution I will have to learn the solution to my problem.
