Context
This year I am learning Javascript. It is where Html websites can have functional action. Using what I learn about javascript,I will be applying what I have learned into my sep11-freedom project because you need a strong foundation for you to know how to code and find error of why it is not working. For my project, I am making a chatbox using my tool(Firebase) with a challenge and the solution I had to find in order to finish the sep11 project. For example I have to find which tool I want to learn in the early blog, while the later blog will be how I learn it using LOYO(Learn On Your Own).
