##### 6/4/2023
### Recap
It started me wanting to challenge myself and wanting to use the hardest tools that could relate to website designing. This is where I use find firebase, it was one of the hardest tools ever, havng many functionality in this one extension. After picking it, I would need to learn more about it myself. In addition I had prior knowledge about firebase, but it was useless due to the latest verion of firebase had change alot of the coding I have known. This gave me a lot of challenges, but I've  perserve with effort and time. In the end after I finished the project and presetion I will be explaining this the last blog like right now .

### Context
After all the hard work me and my classmate have done, it is time for us to show off. Currently we are the the **EDP** is the communication of Result. It is where we finished our product with the mininal viable product and having a presentation. Showing the steps we had to take for each student to get to where they are right now. Amongst it my Project and presentation is about chatting and how online can be better than in real life because of peer pressure and anxiety.

### In-Class Presentation 
For the in [Class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pDoRKaQXPVadhXDwf-0TuSuKAdN5OSBb2EKo4xS-nlw/edit) I have to present about my project. First I would have to give an hook to attract my audience attention then explain the process of how I come to my product. Through last year presentation I wasn't nervous because I had lot of practice and use my last year practice and expierence to made a better one. Even though in this year presentation I didn't get a full score. it is always a good thing to learn and realize your mistake even if it from presenting or from explaining. 


### elevator pitch
An [Elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lijl8W_xwJwV60-3EU42tbs5dD-WwCgUMtA5lWbDDTk/edit#) is a 4-5 sentence paragraph that give out the purpose of your creation. I was nervous at that time because I feel that my website wasn't great compare to other. I had spend most time learning the latest verion of firebase that I didn't made my front cover to look really good even though I had an another extension called bootstrap. In addition while talking to the judge I also have to show my [project](https://jimingz9380.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/sep11-project/) and talking relavent information that would interest my judge about online chat.

Note: The link for the Elevator pitch note is all the way at the bottom.


### Takeaway
The presentation have help me develop the skill of <ins>communication, consideration, and embracing failure</ins>. Communication increases my experience of how to present my product overall. While giving the presentation I would need to consider what should I present that is the most relavent information that I want my audience to know. After the expo I was able to realize that I need to have more than one functionality than a chatbox and better website because comparting to other it was not attractive enough. This was not the only lesson I learn, in the class presentation, I learn that I need to be more specific because I didn't give example of my takeaway and this is an failure that I will fix next time.
