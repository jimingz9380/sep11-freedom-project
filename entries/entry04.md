### Context/EDP
I'm in the **EDP of plan and create**. My first step of working on the year long project is by creating a MVP plan, it will help me later on by spreading out my work. The MVP plan consist of my timeline of which part/section of work I need to work on a certain time period [Link to MVP Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RX5Jm-mMifLN67XyywR_qx98yzZfNcYB55YWVhljAPg/edit). For this year-long project I have to create a front and back end. Front end means that the front page of a website is where everything looks good and the back end means that behind the front page there will be all the hard coding that makes the front page of a website to be working. After completing my plan I started creating a WireFrame, which helps design how your front-end should look because you don't want to make a website that doesn't look good. In Addition you may change it later in the future. Click me for [WireFrame](https://wireframe.cc/umRyWM)

### Create
Something I work on for MVP 

### Next Step
My next step is to continuing working on the my MVP because even though I have finished a part of the MVP I didn't fully complete it. Another part I need to work on is the function of the realtime database for a real time chat box due to the last blog entry I have only learned how to really connect to firebase and some part of the function of realtime database. The chatbox function allow people to talk to each in live chat.  

### Takeaway
This blog entry have help me develop the skills of **time management and organization**. When I created the use it was very beneficial because it will help me reduce stress from working all in one go. For example, if I have never created my plan I might shove all my work in the last month before the MVP project is actually due. This would put a lot of pressure which would affect me mentally and physically. On the other hand, while planning and creating, I have to organize how I should create the website, such as making a wireframe for it.
