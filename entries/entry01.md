### EDP
Right now am currently in the EDP(engineer design Process) number 1 which is defining a problem. The currently problem I have look up for what I want to make and decided on making a history tracking/saving website, there are many why people keep track of history, it can be national, personal, community history, etc. For now I choose tracking history personally because how sometime you want to restart a project, but at the same time you can just go back to a certain point and start from their, so basically I wanna create a javascript base website that would store your music at a certain part of history when you save it.

### Context/Idea/Tools
In order to do this I have decided to use the hardest tool in the option of Sep11 which is Firebase. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) have many function such as realtime data base, cloud firestore, storage and more. My other option were [Aframe](https://aframe.io/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) because typescript will help me solve for tiny error in my code and Aframe was like my last decision of what I want to make this year base on Javascript and will affect my decision of making a history saving webite to a gaming website. After a week I kept firebase and continue to use this tool in order to challenge myself. first thing I did to learn firebase was searching youtube video and use [private video](https://allstarcode-org-education.zoom.us/rec/share/TqerEe6oEfkuKBhoWJMbg89bNoe6NkUEzcJqZ7Pn2HseNWjAwPzRTZPCvBKQbx46.q9O0yl-_YBdI_TyK?startTime=1660137857000). Thus this is how I conclude my year long project with suffering.

### Takeaway
This blog entry have help me developed the skill of Consideration and How to google. It improved my help on google because I need to search for a right video that will actually help me learn something about firebase and not just probably some random outdated video.
