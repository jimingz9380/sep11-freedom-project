# SEP11 Freedom Project
## Context
This year I am learning Javascript. It is where Html website can have funcational action. Using what I learn about javascript,I will be applying what I have learn into my sep11-freedom project because such as function. Function is a certain action depeding the user code when it is called. This is very important because maybe you don't want it always to be giving an output, so it only give an output when it get a input related to the function.

## Content
For my project, I am making a chatbox using my tool(Firebase) with challenge and the solution I had to find in order to finished sep11 project. For exmaple I have to find which tool I want to learn in the early blog, while later blog will be how I learn it using LOYO(Learn On Your Own).
