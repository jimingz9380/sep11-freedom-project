# SEP11 Freedom Project

## Context
This year I am learning Javascript. It is where Html websites can have functional action. Using what I learn about javascript,I will be applying what I have learned into my sep11-freedom project because you need a strong foundation for you to know how to code and find error of why it is not working. For my project, I am making a chatbox using my tool(Firebase) with a challenge and the solution I had to find in order to finish the sep11 project. For example I have to find which tool I want to learn in the early blog, while the later blog will be how I learn it using LOYO(Learn On Your Own).

## Content
This blog entry are the proof I have of how I was able to finised my project. In the first blog it explain how and why I choose my tools and then it explain how I learn my tool on my own. These steps allow me to start creating the website and the project I wanted (Chatbox). Each step I took there were challenge I have to face. It is explain in each blog entries.
